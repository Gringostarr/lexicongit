Okay, I have added the markup without the PHP in so should be easier to see. 
Neither solution seems to work in practice. The text at top and bottom 
cannot be centered and the image should be centered within its container div. 
The container has overflow hidden so I want 
to see the center of the image as that's normally where the focus is.
